        Once Upon a Time, there was an IT guy. We don't really know his name, but he has a red hat.
        Suddenly, a big crash happened! This devastated the entire entire computer industry, but he said he could fix it.
        They all didn't believe him. "How could you, a little guy with a red hat, fix one of the most major crashes of all time?" One of them said.
        "I bet a million cakes he won't do it. ACTUALLY."
        He got really mad. He REALLY wanted to prove them wrong. Press Fix to help him prove them wrong.
