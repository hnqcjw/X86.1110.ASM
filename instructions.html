	<h1>HOW TO PLAY</h1>
	<p>
		When you see a "glitch" (One of those weird mixed-color rectangles you see around),<br/>
		If you go into them, you will go into <i>"debug mode!"</i>
    Be careful, there are software bugs flying around everywhere and
    if you even try touching them, they will physically harm you!<br/>
    When an error message pops up, click it as fast as you can to fix it.
    Good luck!
